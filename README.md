# [My Money](http://mymoney.surge.sh/) - A Personal Finance Tracker
This is a personal project for making a [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) application and learning lots of libraries that probably aren't needed to actually do this.

## Goals
* Let users input their finances into the application and syncs real-time across all users that can view said finances
* Have multiple users be able to share finance tracking as a family.
* Have data visualization using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to view purchase history by category over weeks/months/years.

## Installation
* This project was started using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so you will need to install that first.
`npm install -g create-react-app`
* Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/kotojo/finance_app.git`
* Install Dependencies `npm install`
* Run `npm run start` and the app should start locally and open itself in a browser for you!`
